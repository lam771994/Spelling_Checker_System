# Spelling Checker System

## Objectives

To design and implement a spellcheck system that makes use of a probabilistic model to detect and correct the spelling of the inputs provided by a user. The system was built so that it can detect and correct both non-word and real-word errors by making use of Minimum Edit Distance and N-grams respectively. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was utilized to receive user input, which is cross-referenced against the systemâ€™s corpus to detect errors and suggest alternate options with the highest probabilities of being correct. 

The domain of digital marketing is used to build the corpus. Including domain-specific abbreviations, it contains a total of 202,707 tokens, of which 10,254 are unique tokens or vocabulary that are stored in the form of a variable.
