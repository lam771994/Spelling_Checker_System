# Spelling Checker System

## Objectives

To design and implement a spellcheck system that makes use of a probabilistic model to detect and correct the spelling of the inputs provided by a user. The system was built so that it can detect and correct both non-word and real-word errors by making use of Minimum Edit Distance and N-grams respectively. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was utilized to receive user input, which is cross-referenced against the system’s corpus to detect errors and suggest alternate options with the highest probabilities of being correct. 

The domain of digital marketing is used to build the corpus. Including domain-specific abbreviations, it contains a total of 202,707 tokens, of which 10,254 are unique tokens or vocabulary that are stored in the form of a variable.
